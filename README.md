# Base Naturaliste (frontend)

This is the Angular frontend for Base Naturaliste application.

## About the project

The aim of the Base Naturaliste project is to provide naturalists a software where they can record and visualize their wildlife observations.

Each observation is identified by several characteristics filled in by the user: the context of the observation (e.g. date, location, weather) and the description of the observed specimens (e.g. species, age, behavior).

Gathering all these records permits naturalists to build a mapping of the fauna.

- Create, edit or remove data corresponding to a wildlife observation
- Search through the existing observations using advanced filtering
- Manage the different type of data related to the observations (observers, geographical area...)
- Import data from a CSV file
- Export data as a SQL dump file
