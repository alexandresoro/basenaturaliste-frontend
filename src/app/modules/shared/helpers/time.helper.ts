/**
 * When the backend returns a date, it is always a timestamp string that is independant ofe the time zone.
 * For example, it will return 2020-02-25 to represent a date that is the 25th of February 2020
 * regardless of where you are in the world.
 * However, in a browser, such date will be interpreted as being 2020-02-25 at 00:00:00 UTC time.
 * It means that such date will appear for example as 2020-02-25 at 01:00:00 CET time,
 * if the browser is set up in a computer as CET.
 * It also means that such date will appear for example as 2020-02-24 at 16:00:00 PST time,
 * if the browser is set up in a computer as PST.
 * As in this app, the date represents timestamps regardless of the timezone, we need to offset the browser time zone,
 * so that a date will always show up as 2020-02-25 00:00:00 regardless of the browser time zone.
 * Effectively, in such case, the output will represent a date that corresponds to
 * Tue Feb 25 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (CET) if the browser is in CET, or
 * Tue Feb 25 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST) if the browser is in PST.
 * This offset needs to be reverted when the dates are sent back to the backend, which is done thanks to the opposite method
